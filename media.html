	<h1>Media Project</h1>
	<p>For this project, I wanted to give my audience an inside look of where Cataloonia comes from. I created a music video by using iMovie along with videos and audio from the public domain. I found footage from the National Parks website, pieced a few videos together, and added some sound. I created a storyboard first with an idea of how I wanted this video to look and my video accuaretly displays what my vision was for my storyboard.</p>
